# or
yarn test:coverage
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions

1. Use Jest for testing utility functions
2. Use React Testing Library for testing React components



2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components

1. Test form submissions
2. Test API calls with mock responses



3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test the entire application flow

1. Use Cypress for end-to-end testing
2. Test critical user flows like registration, login, and job application



4. **API Tests**: Test the API endpoints

1. Use Supertest for testing API endpoints
2. Test authentication and authorization





### Test Coverage

Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical parts of the application:

- Authentication
- Job application process
- Admin dashboard functionality
